### Shift Registers


### About Shift Register:
A shift register is a type of digital circuit using a cascade of flip-flops where the output of one flip-flop is connected to the input of the next. They share a single clock signal, which causes the data stored in the system to shift from one location to the next. By connecting the last flip-flop back to the first, the data can cycle within the shifters for extended periods, and in this form they were used as a form of computer memory.
There are basically four kinds of shift register-SISO(Serial In Serial Out),SIPO(Serial In Parallel Out),PIPO(Parallel in Parallel Out ),PISO(Parallel in Series Out).
